to do:
----
improve auto-documentation (pride.components.package)
auto-import pythonjit when live interpreter session is started
type inference?
static typing tutorial

changes
-----
added `get_file_path` function to `pythonjit` module
changed name of db table from "Source_Cache" to "Source_Info"
added conditional doc string in compile.py, due to __doc__ being unassignable when compiled

notes
----


known issues
-----
cannot compile files in /usr folder (e.g. those that come with python) unless running as root, which doesn't seem to be a good idea
    - currently declines to try compiling anything in /usr, even if you are root
